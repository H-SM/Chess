This is a chess application developed using React and npx. It provides a comprehensive chess-playing experience with various features and functionalities. This application provides a digital platform to play the classic game of chess online. It features an intuitive user interface, interactive gameplay, and supports standard chess rules and moves. The application leverages React's component-based architecture and state management to provide a seamless and responsive experience. The application allows you to play a great game of chess and incorporates the following aspects:

- **Normal Piece Movements**: The chess game includes all the standard piece movements, allowing players to move their pieces according to the rules of chess.

- **PossibleMoves Logic**: The application incorporates a robust PossibleMoves logic, which accurately determines the legal moves available to each piece on the board. This ensures that players can only make valid moves based on the rules of chess.

- **En Passant Move**: The chess engine supports the en passant move, which is a special pawn capture that can occur under specific circumstances. This adds depth and strategy to the gameplay.

</p>

- **Castling**: The application includes the castling move, a unique maneuver that allows the king to move two squares towards a rook, while the rook moves to the other side of the king. This defensive move is an important aspect of the game, and players can utilize it to fortify their positions.

- **Checkmate Mechanism & End-Game Notifier**: The application implements a checkmate mechanism to detect when a player's king is in checkmate, resulting in the end of the game. Additionally, an end-game notifier alerts players when the game reaches its conclusion.

- **Built with React & npx**: The application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The use of npx simplifies the setup and execution of the application.

- **Stalemate Logic Pending**: The application currently lacks the implementation of stalemate logic, which results in a draw when a player has no legal moves available but is not in checkmate. This functionality may be added in future updates.

- **Issue with Moving Pieces Outside the Board**: There is an issue in the application where pieces can be moved outside the bounds of the chessboard. This is an area for improvement and will be addressed in future updates.
